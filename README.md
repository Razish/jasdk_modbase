JACoders "modbase" project
********************************

The purpose of this "mod base" is to provide a clean and bug-free base for coders to base their new projects off.
There are dozens of bugs/exploits/glitches in the official SDK. We hope to eliminate re-inventing the wheel with each project having to fix the same old bugs
